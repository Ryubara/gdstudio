class_name UIScreen
extends Control
## Base for a screen the router shows: backdrop, initial focus, back rule and lifecycle hooks.
##
## A screen scene also runs on its own (as a main scene): when its parent is not a Control it
## applies the theme and fills the window itself.

## The node that takes focus when the screen appears.
@export var initial_focus: NodePath
## Whether Esc / gamepad B pops this screen.
@export var allow_back := true
## Whether Esc / gamepad B also closes this screen when it is the only one on the stack, leaving
## the stack empty (`UIRouter.close`). For a menu over a game that is not itself a screen: the
## pause menu. Without it Esc stops at the root, as a main menu wants.
@export var back_closes := false
## Whether this screen draws the token stars (`UITokens.star_count`); turn it off for a screen that
## covers the sky, or leave the count at 0 in the tokens for a game with none.
@export var stars := true:
	set(value):
		stars = value
		_build_stars()
## Overrides the bottom colour of the backdrop gradient (transparent keeps the token).
@export var glow := Color.TRANSPARENT

## What the pusher passed to the router.
