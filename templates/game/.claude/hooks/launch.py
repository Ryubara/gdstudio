"""Runs the GDStudio kit's hook dispatcher for this game (the kit's docs/studio/hooks.md).

The guards live once, in the kit (`<workspace>/repos/gdstudio/.claude/hooks/`), so every game shares them. This
launcher finds the workspace by its marker file and hands the hook input to the kit's dispatcher. Without a workspace
or a kit it lets the call through and says so: run the kit's bootstrap.
