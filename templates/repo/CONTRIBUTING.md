# Contributing to {GAME_TITLE}

Thank you for helping. This page is short on purpose: the rules a program can check live in
[`.github/conventions.yml`](.github/conventions.yml), and the checks tell you what is wrong.

## The flow

1. Start from an issue (the forms ask for what is needed), or open one first for anything larger than a small fix.
2. Work on a branch. `main` takes no direct pushes; every change is a pull request.
3. Give the pull request a title, and its commits messages, that follow the commit rules below.
4. Fill in the pull request template. Every task you list is finished and ticked; work you do not finish goes in
   its own issue. If the pull request finishes an issue, add a line `Fixes #<number>`.
5. A change to the game's code (`game/` outside `assets/`, or `server/`) also changes `docs/` or `README.md`, or
   the description says `Docs: none`.
6. The pull request is squash-merged: the title becomes the one commit on `main`.

## Commit rules

Generated from `.github/conventions.yml` (`groundwork.py render`); what each area covers is listed there.

<!-- conventions:begin commit-rules -->
- Title `area: Verb the rest`, at most 72 characters, present tense, no trailing period. Verbs: Add, Fix, Update,
  Remove, Rebuild, Rework, Improve, Document. Areas: `core`, `gameplay`, `ui`, `net`, `world`, `art`, `audio`,
  `build`, `ci`, `agents`, `docs`, `tests`. A breaking change ends the title with `(BREAKING)`.
- An agent ends the message with `Co-Authored-By: <model name> <noreply address>` (one of: `noreply@anthropic.com`,
  `noreply@google.com`, `noreply@openai.com`) and no other trailer. No other e-mail address appears in a message.
<!-- conventions:end -->

## Checks

The required checks are `pr-rules` (the title, description, docs and commits checks, as the steps of one job),
`conventions`, `build-ok`, `mkdocs`, `markdownlint` and `actionlint`. Before you push,
`uvx pre-commit run --all-files` runs the local ones, and
`uv run --with pyyaml python .github/scripts/groundwork.py check --offline` shows whether the generated files
still match the conventions.

## Pull request labels

Two status labels are kept true on every open pull request by the `pr-status` workflow
(`.github/workflows/pr-status.yml`, logic in `.github/scripts/pr_status.py`). Nobody sets or clears them by hand:
a hand edit is undone the next time the workflow runs.

| Label | On while | Clears when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `S-conflict` | GitHub reports the pull request cannot be merged because it conflicts with its base | the branch is rebased or merged with the base, or the base moves so the conflict is gone |
| `S-ci-failing` | a required check (`merge.required_checks`) failed on the latest commit | a new commit or a re-run passes every required check |

They are re-evaluated when a pull request is opened, pushed to or reopened, when a workflow that carries a required
check finishes, and when the default branch moves (every merge can create a conflict in another pull request). GitHub
computes mergeability lazily, so the workflow asks again for up to half a minute; if GitHub still has no answer it
leaves `S-conflict` as it was and warns. A cancelled run is not a failure. To sweep by hand, run the `pr-status`
workflow from the Actions tab.
