# A zombie placed by hand in a test or a capture snapped back to the fence

2026-11-03

- **Saw:** a capture of the freeze gun showed an empty lot: three zombies had been moved in front of the player
  (`body.position = ...`) and were nowhere to be seen a second later, though the server's hits on them counted.
- **Cause:** a zombie that spawned for a fence breach keeps its `gate_id` until it walks through; while boards
  stand, `ZombieSim._keep_outside_the_boards` puts it back at the boards every step. Moving it by hand changes nothing
  for long. The unit tests did not show it because they placed the zombie and asserted within a few ticks.
- **Fix:** clear `gate_id` (`body.gate_id = &""`) on a zombie a test or a capture puts in the open, and stand it still
  with `speed = 0.0`. Find a lane for a shoulder camera by dropping rays on a grid: the lot's cars block the shot and
  hide a zombie that is only 6 m away.
- **Docs:** Deadnight's `docs/research/status-effects.md` ("Things that bit"), in the game repository.
